				<br>

				<span style="font-size: 130%;">Better Budgeting</span>

				</ul>
				<br>

			<h2>Reasons</h2>
				More funding into medical research could lead to more remedies for major diseases.
				More hospitals in rural areas is because generally the hospitals in rural areas are limited in numbers.
				They can also be far way. This will help for major medical issues that need to be treated immediately.
				<br><br>
				Tutoring for year 12 students will ensure that they focus constantly and meet the required qualifications for all their electives.
				<br><br>
				Labor factories offer lots of jobs. When these factories go bust all the employees have to find new jobs. This can be very hard in some cases. If these factories are assisted they may even expand. Expansion means that more jobs are available. This could completely turn unemployment upside -  down.
				<br><br>
				A small increase in tax means that there is more money that can be distributed into major aspects. Politicians will earn less because they earn far more than they need whilst a lot of that money could be used elsewhere. Less borrowing money means that in the future there will be a lot less debt which means that all the other areas can be better funded.
